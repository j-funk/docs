## Introduction

In this tutorial, we're going to deploy a Next.js application with a PlanetScale database to Vercel, using the PlanetScale integration for Vercel. As a bonus, we've included the sample application code in this tutorial. We'll walk you step-by-step through creating a new PlanetScale database, deploying your application to Vercel, and using the Vercel integration. Excited? Let's go!

## Prerequisites

- Install the [PlanetScale CLI](https://github.com/planetscale/cli).
- Authenticate the CLI with the following command:

```bash
pscale auth login
```

## Setup a PlanetScale database

Now we're ready to start our adventure. Let's begin by setting up our PlanetScale database with a small sample table.

1. Create a new PlanetScale database:

```bash
pscale database create <DATABASE_NAME>
```

This creates a database with one default branch, `main`, which we'll use as the [production branch](/concepts/branching#development-and-production-branches).

2. For development, create a new `development` branch:

```bash
pscale branch create <DATABASE_NAME> <BRANCH_NAME>
```

3. Connect to your database to make a [non-blocking schema change](/concepts/nonblocking-schema-changes):

```bash
pscale shell <DATABASE_NAME> <BRANCH_NAME>
```

4. Create the following example table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE `users` (
  `id` int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  `email` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `password` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `name` varchar(255)
);
```

5. Before making a deploy request, you need a production branch. Promote your `main` branch to production:

```bash
pscale branch promote <DATABASE_NAME> <BRANCH_NAME>
```

6. Create a **deployment request** by running:

```bash
pscale deploy-request create <DATABASE_NAME> <BRANCH_NAME>
```

Copy the `deploy-request-number` and use that digit as your `DEPLOY_REQUEST_NUMBER`.

7. Merge your `development` branch into `main`:

```bash
pscale deploy-request deploy <DATABASE_NAME> <DEPLOY_REQUEST_NUMBER>
```

8. (Optional) Delete your just merged feature branch:

If you are working in a **feature branch workflow**, you may want to delete the old branches:

```
pscale branch delete <database> <branch>
```

_Note_: It could ask you for confirmation unless you provide the `--force` flag

## Deploy to Vercel

We mentioned earlier that we had included a sample Next.js application in this tutorial for you to deploy to Vercel. This demo application creates a `user` with a _name_, _email address_, and _password_. In this section, we're going to connect the Git repository of our sample application to **Vercel**.

1. Click the following **Vercel Deploy** button:

<a
  target='_blank'
  href='https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fplanetscale%2Fvercel-integration-example&project-name=vercel-integration-example&repository-name=vercel-integration-example&integration-ids=oac_ni8CGiTU3oM25q1k2L6unVMp'
>
  <img src='https://vercel.com/button' alt='Deploy with Vercel' />
</a>

Vercel offers the option to clone our repository into GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. In this tutorial, we're using GitHub.

2. Click the **Create** button to create your new Git repository.

## Add Vercel integration

We're almost done! The final thing we need to do is add a Vercel integration to our PlanetScale database.

1. Click the **Add** button to add the PlanetScale integration to this Vercel project.

<InfoBlock type='tip'>
  Make sure you pick the <b>same database</b> that you created in the earlier part of this tutorial so that it has the
  right schema.
</InfoBlock>

This step automatically runs your first **Vercel deployment**.

<InfoBlock type='tip'>
  Every push to <b>main</b> will automatically deploy your application in Vercel.
</InfoBlock>

Once added, the integration creates a service token for your PlanetScale database and adds the necessary [environment variables](https://vercel.com/docs/environment-variables) to your Vercel project:

```
PLANETSCALE_DB
PLANETSCALE_DB_USERNAME
PLANETSCALE_DB_PASSWORD
PLANETSCALE_DB_HOST
PLANETSCALE_SSL_CERT_PATH
PLANETSCALE_ORG
PLANETSCALE_TOKEN
PLANETSCALE_TOKEN_NAME
```

<InfoBlock type='note'>
  <div>
    <b>Removing Vercel integrations:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Environment variables are removed from all projects tied to the integration.</li>
      <li>
        All service tokens are destroyed and your application will no longer be able to connect to your PlanetScale
        database.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <b>Updating Vercel integration permissions:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Old service tokens are removed in deleted projects.</li>
      <li>New service tokens are created and environment variables are added to the project(s).</li>
      <li>
        New projects should have access to the PlanetScale database tied to the integration after installation is done.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</InfoBlock>

All done! Congratulations on successfully deploying your application with a PlanetScale database to Vercel.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we deployed a Next.js application that was connected to a PlanetScale database to Vercel. We chose to use the sample Next.js application we built in this tutorial and then used it to connect to a PlanetScale database.

## What's next?

Now that you've successfully deployed an application to Vercel, it's time to make more schema changes to your tables! Learn more about how PlanetScale allows you to make [non-blocking schema changes](/concepts/nonblocking-schema-changes) to your database tables without locking or causing downtime for production databases.
